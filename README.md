This repository contains a collection of small Python projects developed using graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Included projects are:

Rock Paper Scissors Game: A simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" where users can play against the computer.

To-Do List Application: A basic to-do list manager that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed, providing a straightforward way to organize tasks.

Calculator Application: A simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) built with Python and a graphical interface for ease of use.

These projects serve as practical examples of GUI development in Python and can be used as learning resources for beginners interested in Python programming and GUI development.
